# Pipeline Design

- How does the DevOps choose what program to use?
- How does the DevOps design the pipeline?
- What criteria does the DevOps have in mind when it comes to design the pipeline?

# The cult of DevOps

--

- what makes a good DevOps guy?
- how many DevOps should a team has?
- is the DevOps guy also the infra guy?
