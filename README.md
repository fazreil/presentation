# CICD:
## The Agile Release ([Silver] Bullet) Train

--

# who/what is DevOps?

--

- DevOps is a culture, a practise.
- But like Agile Coaches, you have DevOps engineers to cultivate the culture.

--

# DevOps do what actually?

--

- Connect between Development and Operations
- Build pipeline
- Enhance build by probing it
- Shift left operations into development stage

---

# Pipeline Design

--

- How does the DevOps choose what program to use?
- How does the DevOps design the pipeline?
- What criteria does the DevOps have in mind when it comes to design the pipeline?
- Pipeline, what pipeline?

--

### The DevOps Periodic Table

# The cult of DevOps

--

- what makes a good DevOps guy?
- how many DevOps should a team has?
- is the DevOps guy also the infra guy?

--

### devops guy

--

### devops guy
- make fun of the devs
- also make fun of the ops (infra)
- devops can do both
