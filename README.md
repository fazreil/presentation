# CICD:

--

# who/what is DevOps?

--

- DevOps is a culture, a practise.
- But like Agile Coaches, you have DevOps engineers to cultivate the culture.

--

# DevOps do what actually?

--

- Connect between Development and Operations
- Build pipeline
- Enhance build by probing it
- Shift left operations into development stage

---

# Pipeline Design

--

- How does the DevOps choose what program to use?
- How does the DevOps design the pipeline?
- What criteria does the DevOps have in mind when it comes to design the pipeline?
- Pipeline, what pipeline?

--

### The DevOps Periodic Table

I usually use this table to decide what to put in the pipeline

--

#### The DevOps Utopia: The tools: roadmap

- Setting up CICD does not have to be complex
- Go along the maturity of the team
- We are incepting the DevOps culture, try not to cause culture shock
- Start small: like how Ekipa and I do. We just use github and netlify
- Go enterprise: use tools seen in the periodic table.

# The cult of DevOps

--

- what makes a good DevOps Engineer?
- how many DevOps should a team has?
- is the DevOps guy also the infra engineer?

### DevOps Engineer
- make fun of the devs
- also make fun of the ops (infra)
- devops can do both
- one day they may also have management skills
